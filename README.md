# Linked-List-Medical-Office-Management-System-C

The Linked-list Medical Management System is the first project developed for the Programming Project discipline at the university. It leverages the knowledge of C programming language and data structures gained in the first half of the semester to create an intuitive and effective application for healthcare providers to manage patient data.

The application is implemented as a CLI, with a user-friendly interface that offers various functionalities to manage patient records. The core data structure used is a Linked List, which allows for efficient storage and management of patient records.

The system offers several CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage patient data. These include adding new patients, editing existing patient records, searching for patients by name or ID, displaying patients scheduled for consultation on the current day, generating patient reports, viewing all patients, deleting all patients, and exiting the program.

To ensure data integrity, the system also contains validations when performing CRUD operations. These validations prevent errors and ensure that the data stored in the system is accurate and consistent.
